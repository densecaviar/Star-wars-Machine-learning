Star Wars: AI Evasion Project
Hey there! This project is a Pygame simulation where you, as Luke Skywalker, face off against Darth Vader. The cool part? Vader's dodging skills are powered by different types of Machine Learning! It's a fun way to see how AI learns and adapts right in front of you.

What You Can Do

Play as Luke:

Move left and right at the bottom of the screen using Left/Right Arrow Keys or A/D.

Fire blue energy beams upwards by pressing SPACE.

Fight Against Vader (The AI):

Vader moves back and forth across the top of the screen.

He'll occasionally shoot red energy beams down at you. Watch out!

Game Rules:

Hit Vader with your blue beam to win.

If Vader's red beam hits you, it's game over.

After a win or loss, press R to quickly restart the game.

Choose Vader's Brain:

At the start, a menu lets you pick which AI strategy Vader will use.

Use Up/Down Arrow Keys to browse options.

Press ENTER once to read a short explanation of how that AI works.

Press ENTER again to confirm your choice and jump into the game.

Learn About AI: This project is built to help you visually understand different machine learning ideas in an interactive way.

How Vader Learns: The Machine Learning Strategies
We're exploring several ways to make Vader smart. Here's a look at the AI types you can choose for him:

Rule-Based (Basic Movement): Vader follows a simple, fixed pattern. He'll just move back and forth. This is a good starting point to see how basic AI behaves.

Reinforcement Learning (Learning by Doing): In this mode, Vader learns through experience. He gets "rewards" for dodging your beams and "penalties" if he gets hit. Over time, he'll figure out the best ways to move to avoid your attacks.

Genetic Algorithm (Evolving Skills): Imagine many "versions" of Vader playing the game. The ones that dodge best "survive" and pass on their successful dodging traits to new Vaders. This shows how AI can evolve over many rounds.

Neural Network (Pre-Trained Smarts): Here, Vader's movements are controlled by a neural network that has already been taught how to dodge by playing many simulated games. It's like he's already a dodging expert!

Simple Heuristic (Smart Guessing): This AI tries to predict where your beams will go and moves to avoid that spot. It's a bit like Vader is making smart guesses based on the beam's path.

(Note: Currently, Vader uses the basic Rule-Based movement. The other AI types are planned for future updates!)

Get Started: How to Play
Run the Game: Just execute the Python script (your_game_file_name.py).

Pick an AI: On the starting screen:

Use UP and DOWN arrows to highlight an AI type.

Press ENTER to read its description.

Press ENTER again to start the game with that AI.

Control Luke:

Move Left: LEFT ARROW or A

Move Right: RIGHT ARROW or D

Shoot: SPACEBAR

Win the Battle: Avoid Vader's red beams and hit him with your blue ones!

Play Again: After a round, press R to restart and pick a new AI.

Exit: Press Q anytime to quit the game.

Setup Instructions
What You Need
Python 3.x

Pygame library

Installation
Get the Code:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-wars-ai-evasion.git
cd star-wars-ai-evasion

Install Pygame:

pip install pygame

Running the Game
Make sure your luke.png and vader.png image files are in the same folder as your Python script.

Then, run it from your terminal:

python your_game_file_name.py # Remember to use your actual script name!

What's Next
Implementing all the cool machine learning algorithms for Vader's dodging.

Adding scores and maybe a high-score list.

More levels or ways to make the game harder.

Making the visuals and sounds even better!
